    "#### The purpose of this program is to allow any users to reproduce the analysis. You may choose to modify or add new data into the raw dataset before analysis. You are asked to analyze and compare nutrient/sediment export from two adjacent agricultural catchments by simply running the program. Discuss the outputs of nitrogen and phosphorus (ignore other analytes). Use total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for your discussions.\n",
